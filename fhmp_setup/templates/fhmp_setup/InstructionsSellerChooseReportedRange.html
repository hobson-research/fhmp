Instructions: Seller Chooses a Reported Range
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<p>
    After each seller receives the Private Range, the seller chooses to report a range of
    numbers to let buyers know what their asset value is likely to be. We will call the range the seller reports to
    buyers the Reported Range. The Reported Range is only 3 numbers wide (for example 5-7).
</p>

<p>Here is one important point:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>The seller can report any range. That is, the seller's Reported Range does not have to contain any numbers from the 
        Private Range they were given. For example, if the Private Range is 9-11, a seller could report a range of 1-3 or 9-11 
        or 18-20.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    In summary, the seller reports a range. The seller can pick any range to report to buyers.
