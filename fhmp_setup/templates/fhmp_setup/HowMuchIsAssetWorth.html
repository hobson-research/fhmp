How much is each asset worth?
{% endblock %}

<p>
    Each asset in this game has a true value between 1 and 20, but no one knows the true value until after the asset is
    sold. Instead, the seller is told an estimate (a three number range of the most likely values) of the asset, but, this may or may not
    end up being the actual assetâ€™s true value. We will refer to the range the seller knows as the Private Range going forward. 
    Even though the Private Range may not contain the true asset value, it is usually close. We show this
    on the next screen.
