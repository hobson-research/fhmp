<p>
    In this study there are 3 sellers, 4-6 buyers, and an automated fact checker. You are a either a seller or a buyer.
    You will play that role for 24 rounds (4 practice rounds and 20 actual rounds). At the end of the instructions you
    will be told which role you have-either a seller or a buyer. The computer is the fact checker.
</p>

<p>
    Every round, each seller has one asset to sell and buyers bid on those sellersâ€™ assets. Buyers can bid on as many
    assets as they want.
</p>

<p>
    Sellers earn points by selling assets. Sellers will earn more points by selling assets for higher prices.
    <br />
    Buyers earn points by winning the assets they bid on. But, winning buyers must pay so buyers earn more points when
    they win assets at lower prices.
