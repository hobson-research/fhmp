    Next, letâ€™s review how you earn points.
</p>

<p>
    In each round, each seller and each buyer is given an initial endowment of points.
</p>

<p>
    In exchange for a winning bid, the winning <strong>buyer</strong> earns the true value of the asset less the amount
    paid for the asset. Losing buyers and buyers that did not bid pay nothing and win nothing.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sellers</strong> earn whatever the highest bid was for their asset.
</p>

<p>
    These points accumulate each round. After the whole study is over you will be paid cash based upon your total
    accumulated points.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, the more points you earn today the more cash you will receive when the study is over.
