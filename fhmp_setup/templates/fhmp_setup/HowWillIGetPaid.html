How will I get paid?

<p>
	The more points you have at the end of the study the more money you will
	receive.
</p>

<p>
	Specifically, after we have finished collecting data for this study, you will
	be paid in US dollars using the following formula:
</p>

<div class="formula-box">
	US$ Payment = (Net Gain or Loss in Points + "Adjustment Factor") x Exchange
	Rate
</div>

<p>
	We will send you an email when your payment is ready to be picked up. The
	exchange rate and adjustment factor are estimated so that the average amount
	of money paid per person is about $25. However, the amount you actually
	receive depends on how many points you earn today. Thus, you could make a lot
	more or less than $25. The main thing to keep in mind is that the more points
	you earn, the more money you will be paid.
